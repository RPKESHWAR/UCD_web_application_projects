UCD_Web_application_projects Description:


During my Master's in UCD, I worked on two real time based web application projects. One was a part of Reasearch Practicum project called "Prediction of Dublin Bus Journey Times", and the other web development project was a part of Software Engineering Module called "Dublin Bike Web Application". I have uploaded both these projects in the master branch of this Git repository. Please go to the master branch of UCD_web_application-projects repository.
